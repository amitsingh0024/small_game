Why this fits well
Grid-based movement: Good for navigating puzzle spaces
LittleJS: Handles multiple objects, interactions, and state
Progressive exploration: Unlock areas as puzzles are solved
Clear structure: Each puzzle can be a distinct area

Suggested structure
Map Layout:- Starting area (tutorial)- Puzzle zones (each with unique mechanics)- Transition areas (exploration between puzzles)- Final area (boss puzzle or finale)
Next steps
Start with one puzzle area (e.g., a simple switch/button puzzle)
Add basic interaction system (player can interact with objects)
Create a simple inventory system
Design one puzzle as a proof of concept
